# React Native Challenge

to install dependencies: yarn install
to run yarn expo start --ios project

Project made with:
React Native,
TypeScript,
Styled Components,
redux,
Redux Toolkit and Expo.


I decided to do this project using Expo, so I wouldn't waste time with the environment and be able to explore this test to the fullest with the knowledge I've been accumulating during 6 years as a developer.

Thanks for the opportunity!
